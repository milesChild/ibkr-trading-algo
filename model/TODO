                                                 ## To Do List ##

1) Add options functionality for each strategy
   - Prompt user for shares/options?
   - Contract selection algo

2) Multiple symbol functionality
   - Create symbol libraries to choose from?
   - Prompt user for desired symbols to trade?

3) Integrate user account data
   - Perpetually update account balance information

4) Complex/recurrent sell orders for certain strategies (exit strategy is not P/L based)

5) Create an optimal data-mgmt system for strategies to do computations based on historical/incoming data
   - Use pandas to convert data requests into a CSV file?
        1) Require the strategies individually to make specific data requests
        2) Store in a central location, keep track of the file names that were used to make the trade
        3) Clear the cache (appropriately) when a trade is executed (for data use optimization)

5) Create GUI in html, push to AWS
   - Make a user guide

6) Populate the strategies section (last)
   - supply zones (volume accumulation)
   - support/resistance break
   - fibonacci retracements
   - 9ema crosses over VWAP (5min)
   - prop. fib retracement strategy (mine)

7) Update bot to work remotely and be compatible with any desktop

8) README

9) ML model for certain strategies?
