TODO List for Strategies:

1.) Implement a scaled entry and exit system

2.) Implement a system for storing/identifying the proper position size for a trade

3.) Design a strategy that makes scaled entries based on chart events (/ determine if necessary)

4.) Implement smart options contract selector (I have an algo for this somewhere, we can make a variety of selectors)

NOTES:

- IBKR provides a SCALE TRADER ALGO which allows the trade to execute incrementally at better prices (good for
  entering into a declining market/sell into top of range for scaling out)
